# Data_Analysis
## Introduction
After learning the fundamentals of data analytics, I applied the skills I learned to undertake several data analytics projects. Here are some projects that I have completed.
- [Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Exploring%20the%20NYC%20Airbnb%20Market)
- [Word Frequency in Classic Novels](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Word%20Frequency%20in%20Classic%20Novels)
- [Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA](https://github.com/kbmrdw/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Reducing%20Traffic%20Mortality%20in%20the%20USA)

## Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market
In the Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market project, I applied data importing and cleaning skills to analyze the Airbnb market in New York. I ingested and combined the data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.  

Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:
- What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
- How many adverts are for private rooms?
- How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

## Word Frequency in Classic Novels
In this Project, I scraped a novel from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package `requests`. Then you'll extract words from this web data using `BeautifulSoup`. Finally, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (`nltk`) and `Counter`.

## Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA
While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80s, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic related-fatalities has now reached a ten year high and is rapidly increasing.

By looking at the demographics of traﬃc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?

To accomplish these tasks, we will make use of data wrangling, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering.

The data given to us was originally collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This particular dataset was compiled and released as a CSV-file by FiveThirtyEight under the CC-BY4.0 license.
